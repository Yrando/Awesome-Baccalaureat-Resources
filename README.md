# Awesome-Baccalaureat-Resources
Hello and welcome aboard.

This repository is meant to be as a guide for baccalaureat students.

The goal of this repository is to be an awesome guide book guidebook for past or future students made by students to help each other in an easy to access format.

as you may see for now it looks a bit empty in here so feel free to help by making a commit or forking the repository.

The main focus of this repository will be on The "Science Math" branch as this is what i'm actively pursuing, There would be mentions of other branches as well but for the most part SM will be more prevalent.
